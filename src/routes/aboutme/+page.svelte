      I'm BendegÃºz Kun, aka <span class="gradient-text">Qnbie</span>, a true-hearted nerd from
      Hungary. Currently, I am utilising my CS degree and working as a .NET backend engineer. Still,
      in the past, I have worked as an SDET, Cybersecurity SME, manual test coordinator, and for a
      few months, as a technical artist for a small studio. Throughout the years, I picked up some
      DevOps-related knowledge regarding building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, and since 2023, I
      have only owned Linux machines in my personal life; I have extensive proficiency in that topic
      as well. Regarding the future of my career, I want to shift my focus from C# to some
      lower-level programming language, like C++ or Rust, and with that, break into the 3D graphics
      industry or become a video game developer.

    <h3 class="my-5 gradient-text">I use Arch btw... at least on my ThinkPad.</h3>

      My main hobby is games. I'm into video games, board games and TTRPGs (mainly as a forever GM).
      I not only like to play them, but also analyse them with my friends and make them as well.
      With my lovely game dev group, Mythi Shrimp Studio, we are regularly participating in game
      jams with various degrees of success and almost always have one or two games in production. My
      other hobby is learning. I'm curious to dip my toes into various topics, both technical and
      non-technical. Currently, I'm learning to draw and music theory to use them to make electronic
      music in the future. Before that, I learned how to create web apps with Svelte (and this site
      was born), how to do woodworking and carpentry, how to ferment stuff on your own and a lot of
      different things. I can say this all learning stuff is part of my life philosophy in a way,
      because during these processes, you not only get to know the process of making something, but
      you get a lot of other experience that you can utilise in separate parts of your journey
      through life.

      So yeah, that is me, and I hope you like my extended introduction. This website, whose name is <span
        class="gradient-text">Discognito</span
      >, is meant to capture my projects and thoughts to share them with the world. The tech stack
      that I used to build <span class="gradient-text">Discogniot</span> and my other projects is
      not necessarily the most sensible, but they never meant to be. They are experimental and
      highly opinionated to showcase my interests. My only rules are to minimise the use of AI for
      this website (mainly using it for minimal editorial stuff to catch the grammar issues) and
      <span class="highlight-text">do it for fun.</span>
